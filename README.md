# kolektiv (Andrew Cherry)

Hello! I'm mainly working in [Rust](https://rustlang.org) (or experimental languages using Rust), plus languages that compile to [WASM](https://webassembly.org), but not much of my output in that ecosystem is particularly relevant for public consumption. I'm usually working on R&D-type approaches to wider programming questions, as I'm not so involved in programming for direct problem solving commercially these days (although some recent projects may change that!).

I did spend a lot of time in the [F#](https://fsharp.org) ecosystem although I've largely left that space. However, looking at downloads, a fair number of people are still using some of the libraries I wrote during that time, particularly the more general purpose libraries around optics (lenses, etc.), graphs and arrow-based composition. The Freya web framework is also still quite interesting (in my entirely subjective opinion) -  it implements some approaches to defining and optimising APIs which I've still never seen anywhere else (exercise for the reader - Freya optimises the decision graph for HTTP request handling at startup time, how much more interesting might this be at compile time in a suitable language?) All of that software is available in the [Xyncro](https://github.com/xyncro) organisation.

I've got a few projects slowly coalescing in the background (though with some lengthy hiatuses) which are semi-practical. They cover:
* Human memory/cognition augmentation through automatically generated connectome models
* Home Automation (home as a reactive system)
* General stream-based visual programming with strong static-typing at the graph level
* Augmentation/facilitation of group decision making through guided interactions and exploration

If any of this sounds interesting and you fancy talking about it, do get in touch.

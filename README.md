# kolektiv (Andrew Cherry)

Hello! I'm mainly working in [Rust](https://rustlang.org) (or experimental languages using Rust), plus languages that compile to [WASM](https://webassembly.org), although I still stay current with a variety of other languages (JS/TS, C#/F#, C, etc.). I'm  working on a few things which might be of interest generally, such as [Open Modular][https://github.com/open-modular/open-modular], a modular synthesis composition and performance platform. I'm also planning on diving into some of the open social protocols soon, I think there's an interesting ecosystem to be built on emerging.

I did spend a lot of time in the [F#](https://fsharp.org) ecosystem, although I've largely left that space. However, looking at downloads, a fair number of people still use some of the libraries I wrote during that time, particularly the more general-purpose libraries around optics (lenses, etc.), graphs and arrow-based composition. The Freya web framework is also still quite interesting (in my entirely subjective opinion) -  it implements some approaches to defining and optimising APIs which I've still never seen anywhere else (exercise for the reader - Freya optimises the decision graph for HTTP request handling at startup time, how much more interesting might this be at compile time in a suitable language? Something like Zig might make for exciting decision optimisation code!) All that software is available in the [Xyncro](https://github.com/xyncro) organisation.

I've got a few projects slowly coalescing in the background (though with some lengthy hiatuses), which are semi-practical. They cover:
* Human memory/cognition augmentation through automatically generated connectome models
* Home Automation (home as a reactive system)
* General stream-based modular programming with strong static typing at the graph level
* Augmentation/facilitation of group decision-making through guided interactions and exploration

If any of this sounds interesting and you would like to talk about it, please feel free to get in touch.
